        Exploring Gumball Fandom
      </h2>
      <p className='text-lg mb-4 text-blue-800'>
        Our project delves into how <em>The Amazing World of Gumball</em> has
        cultivated a vibrant fan culture. By blending comedy, pop culture
        references, and social criticisms, the show has become a prime example
        of contemporary fan culture trends.
      </p>
      <p className='text-lg mb-4 text-blue-800'>
        We compare Gumball’s fan culture to similar shows like{' '}
        <em>Steven Universe</em> and <em>Adventure Time</em>, analyzing how
        these communities celebrate their favorite stories while contributing to
        their cultural significance.
      </p>
      <p className='text-lg text-blue-800'>
        Through research, data visualization, and analysis, we aim to uncover
        how fandoms like Gumball’s impact societal connections and reshape how
        fans consume and appreciate media.
